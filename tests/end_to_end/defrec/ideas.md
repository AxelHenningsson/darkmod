Notes On Deformation Gradient Reconstruction
-------------------------------------------

New things we are doing:
    - Simulating a Gaussian beam profile.
    - Simulating an orthogonal mount.
    - Simulating the effect of sample tilting in the beam.
    - Simulating full image formation.
    - Simulating cross talk effects (projected rays).
    - Reconstrucing moments form the intensity images.
    - Reconstructing the Q field.
    - Backpropagating the Q field to the sample plane.
    - Computationally: introducing tomographic operators.

Things to consider in future:
    - The spatial artefacts due to off-set from optical axis.
    - The effect of the beam profile to the smearing of the field.
    - The effect of noise on the detector images.
    - The effect of integrating over angular range.
    - The effect of non-Gaussian resolution functions.
    - Simulating wall vs orthogonal mounting.
