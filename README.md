darkmod - A Model of Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy 
======================================================

This package is a forward model for Dark field X-ray Microscopy allowing for simulation of diffraction based image formation from samples that are spatially extended on 3D voxeldated grids.

In addition, it supports reconstruction of defomration gradient tensor fields from multiple reflection data.

This repository is provided as is, and is not intended to be a packaged and indexed python library. The associated journal publication is currenlty under review for Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids.

installation
==============================
